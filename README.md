Collection of IT companies, conferences, education, certificates, communities, podcasts, and internships in Croatia â€” within the industry departments of information technology, software development, IT services, and IT consulting.

To ensure accuracy and relevancy, regular updates are conducted on a monthly basis. This involves the addition of newly established entities while removing inactive or defunct entities from the collection. By maintaining this approach, the focus is to offer a reliable and up-to-date resource for seeking information about IT in Croatia.
